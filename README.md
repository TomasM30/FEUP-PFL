- Isaac is played on a 10x10 board, and it has 2 phases. There are two players: Dark and Light. Each player has 15 rectangular tiles of 5 different sizes. Each tile has a score written on it.

## The placement phase (begins with an empty board)
- Starting with the Dark, players take turns placing one of their tiles per turn onto unoccupied cells of the board.
- If a player cannot put any of his remaining tiles on his turn, then he passes, and the other player puts any tiles he can.
- It ends when both players don't have space to put any of their tiles on the board. All the remaining tiles are set apart and serve the role of the tiebreaker. If both players get the same score by the end of the scoring phase, each player forms a line with all his unplayed tiles and the player with the longest line of the unplayed tiles wins the game. If the lines are of equal length, the player who started the game wins. Note that the length of each tile is not a round number of board squares but a little bit shorter.

## The scoring phase
- At the beginning both players have 0 points. To indicate this both players put their score counter on the 00 square according to their own coordinates. If the mentioned square is under some tile, the score counter goes on top of this tile.
- The first player that passed in the Placement phase begins the Scoring phase. The players take turns removing one of their tiles from the board. The removed tile must be at least as long as any tile previously removed by the same player (e.g. if a player has previously removed a 4-cells tile then he can't remove his 3-cells tiles anymore). A player may not remove a tile lying under a score counter (of any colour).
- The result is the score earned by the removal of the tile. It indicates the maximum number of squares that the player's score counter may be moved.
- The counter canâ€™t be placed in the same cell as the opponent's counter.
- The game ends when any player scores at least 100 points. If a player cannot remove any of his tiles on his turn, he passes and is out of the game. The game ends when both players have passed.

## End of the game 
- The game ends when a player scores at least 100 points. If a player cannot remove one of his/her pieces, he/she passes and is out of the game. It ends when both players have passed.
